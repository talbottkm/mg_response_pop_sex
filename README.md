prim_resist10 = log10(prim_resist + 1)
prim_toleye = max combined eyescore between 7 & 14 days post initial inoculation, used to calculate tolerance

1Cmanuscript_InitialAnalyses_20250827.R = R code for analyses investigating responses to initial inoculation, using birds receiving 0 or 750 CCU MG

1Cmanuscript_Main_20250828.R = R code for analyses for main manuscript, investigating responses to a second inoculation, using only birds that received 750 CCU MG during the initial inoculation
